# Fight Recognition Using 3D ResNet

Using pre-trained models from [3D-ResNets-PyTorch](https://github.com/kenshohara/3D-ResNets-PyTorch/blob/master/main.py) and training them on [Surveillance Camera Fight Dataset](https://github.com/sayibet/fight-detection-surv-dataset)

### Surveillance Camera Fight Dataset
* There are 300 videos in total as 150 fight + 150 non-fight
* Videos are 2-second long
* Only the fight related parts are included in the samples
